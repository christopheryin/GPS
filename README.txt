This project was completed for the course ECE 174: Intro to Linear and Nonlinear Optimization taught by Professor Kreutz-Delgado at the University of California, San Diego during Fall Quarter 2017.

The file "GPS Project Prompt" details the expectation of this course project.

The file "GPS with Gradient Descent Report" is the full report for this project, including algorithm derivation and comparison of gradient descent performances.

The MATLAB file "GPS.m" contains the code to execute the GPS algorithms and obtain relevant metrics on algorithm performance.
